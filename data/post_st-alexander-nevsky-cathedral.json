      "content": "<p>Alexander Nevsky Cathedral is a monumental Neo-Byzantine Eastern Orthodox cathedral and one of Sofia’s most iconic landmarks. Construction began in 1882, with the main phases completed between 1904 and 1912. Until 2000, it was the largest completed Eastern Orthodox cathedral in the world, and it remains the largest completed church in the Balkan Peninsula today.</p><p>Distinguished by its massive gilded domes and the extensive use of precious building materials sourced from across Europe, the cathedral’s immense scale and lavish design have made it one of Bulgaria’s most important national symbols and a must-visit attraction for travelers to Sofia.</p><p>The cathedral was originally built to commemorate Russian soldiers who died in the Russo-Turkish War, a conflict that paved the way for Bulgaria’s independence from the Ottoman Empire. It is named after Alexander Nevsky, a medieval Russian prince celebrated as both a military commander and a statesman, who successfully resisted invasions by the Swedes and the Teutonic Knights, thereby securing the position of Eastern Orthodoxy in Eastern Europe.</p><p>During the First World War, between 1916 and 1920, when Bulgaria and Russia found themselves on opposing sides, the cathedral was temporarily renamed Sts. Cyril and Methodius Cathedral. Shortly after the war ended, its original name was restored.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Even before arriving in Bulgaria, I had already been drawn to Alexander Nevsky Cathedral through images online. Its monumental scale and striking architectural design immediately captured my attention, and I was convinced it would be an essential stop in Sofia. Stepping inside the cathedral exceeded all expectations. This was my first time visiting an Eastern Orthodox church, and also my first encounter with a grand Byzantine-style interior, making the experience especially memorable.</p><p>Unlike Gothic churches, the interior lacks visible columns supporting the vast space. Instead, visitors are greeted by an expansive hall beneath an enormous central dome. Due to the small windows positioned high near the dome, the interior remains dim and solemn even on bright sunny days. The soft glow of candlelight and lamps illuminates the walls and ceilings, revealing magnificent and finely detailed frescoes that enhance the atmosphere of mystery and reverence.</p><p>As an Eastern Orthodox church, the main altar differs greatly from those found in Catholic churches. There are no large crucifixes or rows of pews. Instead, icons of saints line the interior, and worshippers approach them to kiss, touch, or whisper their prayers. I found myself deeply moved watching people pray—regardless of faith, the sincerity and conviction in their expressions were unmistakable.</p><p>Unfortunately, photography is not permitted inside the cathedral, so I could not capture images to share—only words to convey the profound impression it left on me.</p>"
