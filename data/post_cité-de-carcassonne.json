      "content": "<p>Carcassonne is a UNESCO-listed medieval fortified city and one of France’s most iconic historic landmarks.</p><p>With a history spanning over 2,500 years, the site began as a Gallic settlement before being transformed into a Roman defensive stronghold. Over the centuries, successive powers—including the Saracens, the Cathars, forces of the Albigensian Crusade, and ultimately the Kingdom of France—expanded and reinforced its defences, shaping Carcassonne into the formidable fortress seen today.</p><p>The citadel is distinguished by its rare double ring of defensive walls and 52 towers of varying sizes. Within the walls lies a complete medieval town, with churches, streets, and a central castle, forming a self-contained “city within a city” that was once considered virtually impregnable.</p><p>Owing to its strategic position near the Spanish border, Carcassonne played a crucial role in defending southern France until the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659 shifted the Franco-Spanish border south to the Pyrenees Mountains, bringing its military importance to an end.</p><p>Despite narrowly escaping demolition in the 19th century, the fortress was preserved thanks to public opposition and the restoration work of Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, whose legacy can also be seen at Mont-Saint-Michel and Notre-Dame de Paris. Today, Carcassonne stands as one of the most complete and evocative medieval fortifications in Europe.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Even before arriving in Bulgaria, I was captivated by images of Alexander Nevsky Cathedral online. Its grandeur and architectural design immediately drew my attention, and I knew it would be a must-visit location in Sofia.</p><p>Stepping inside the cathedral was breathtaking. It was my first time entering an Eastern Orthodox church and also my first experience in a massive Byzantine-style building. The interior is very different from Gothic churches: there are no supporting columns disrupting the space, so the expansive hall beneath the huge central dome feels open and awe-inspiring.</p><p>Because the small windows are only near the central dome, the interior remains dim even when the sun is shining brightly outside. Candlelight and lamps illuminate the walls and ceilings, highlighting the intricate murals and adding to the sense of sacred mystery.</p><p>The main altar is also very different from Catholic churches. Instead of a large statue of Jesus and rows of pews, there are rows of icons. Worshippers approach the icons to kiss, touch, or whisper their prayers. Watching the people pray was deeply moving; regardless of faith, their expressions showed sincerity and unwavering devotion. Unfortunately, photography is not allowed inside the cathedral, so I could only try to convey my impressions through words.</p>"

      "content": "<h1>Legend of Lady Carcas</h1><p>According to legend, the name Carcassonne originates from Lady Carcas, a Saracen noblewoman who defended the city during a prolonged siege by Charlemagne’s army. After the city’s lord was killed in battle, Lady Carcas took command and maintained the illusion of a well-defended stronghold by displaying dummy soldiers along the walls.</p><p>As the siege dragged on and supplies dwindled, she devised a final ruse. A pig was fattened with the city’s last remaining wheat and thrown from the ramparts. Seeing this, Charlemagne’s forces believed the city still had abundant provisions and abandoned the siege.</p><p>As the army withdrew, Lady Carcas rang the city’s bells in celebration. The departing soldiers are said to have exclaimed “Carcas sonne”—“Carcas is ringing”—a phrase from which the city’s name is traditionally believed to derive.</p>"
